        description: "In this dribbling drill, players weave through cones while maintaining close control of the ball. The focus is on using both feet, keeping touches quick, and improving agility. This exercise helps players maneuver in tight spaces and control the ball under pressure, simulating in-game scenarios where defenders are nearby.",

Variations like one-touch passing or adding defenders make it more challenging. It enhances a playerâ€™s spatial awareness and decision-making in real-game situations.",

        description: "One player acts as the attacker, trying to dribble past the defender and score on a small goal or target. The defender must maintain their stance, anticipate movements, and tackle cleanly. This drill enhances both defensive and attacking skills, with attackers focusing on creativity and control, while defenders work on positioning, timing, and reading the game.",

        description: "Players are divided into small teams (e.g., 3v3 or 4v4) and play on a smaller field with mini-goals or normal goals. This drill emphasizes quick decision-making, teamwork, and ball control under pressure. The smaller space and fewer players ensure more touches on the ball, promoting improved dribbling, passing, and movement off the ball. Variations can include touch restrictions (e.g., two-touch play) or limited time to score, simulating high-pressure, real-game situations.",
